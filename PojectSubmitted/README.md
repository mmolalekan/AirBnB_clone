We are currently working on a project that involves replicating the console of the Airbnb platform: https://www.airbnb.com/.

# The Console

Description

The Command Interpreter, also known as the Console, serves as the control center for the entire application's functionality through the command line. It facilitates a range of tasks, including:

	> Creating new objects.
	> Retrieving objects from various sources like files, databases, etc.
	> Performing operations on objects, such as counting, computing statistics, and more.
	> Modifying attributes of objects.
	> Deleting objects from the system.

How to Use

	> To start the console application in interactive mode, simply execute:

		'console.py'

	> Alternatively, for non-interactive mode, use:

		'echo "your-command-goes-here" | ./console.py'
